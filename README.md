# MathDash
Addition and Subtracting racing game. Sike, I tried. I saved the code for the math game which is really cool. But for now FAST AND THE FURIOUS!!!

#FastAndTheFurious
The goal of this project was to utilize all of the skills we have learned thus far and create a game that uses Jquery, JS, CSS, and HTML, to manipulate DOM objects.

#Technologies Used
Jquery, JS, CSS, and HTML


#Existing Features

-Players can race against the computer at randomly selected speeds. Both players have the same probability in terms of speed selection but the manual player has to press space to jump the car into gear.

-The leaderboard tells who won the round

-The "Start your engines" button begins the round.

-The "Race Again" button restarts a new round.

#Planned Features

-I plan on incorporating my addition and Subtracting feature and converting this game to a children's math game.

-plan on making the background animated as well.
